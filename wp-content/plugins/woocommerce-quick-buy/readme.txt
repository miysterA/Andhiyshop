== Upgrade Notice ==
Dear Users,

I recently published WC Quick Buy V2.0 which is a brand new version developed from the base which also includes Robust WPOnion & VSP Framework to make this plugin run smoothly and add more features on the go.

But due to recent changes to the core. I was unable to migrate settings from the older version into the new version. I apologize for this.

but I made sure that new settings are easy to configure. if you do have any issues please do contact me via this forum or email me directly. I will try my best to get back to you asap.
